# PREDICTIVE-ANALYTICS-IN-DIABETES
Project Overview
This project is a Diabetes Prediction Web Application built using Python and Django. It leverages a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user input data. The model is trained on the well-known PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset and uses various health metrics like glucose level, blood pressure, and BMI to provide predictions.

The web application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their medical data and get instant predictions on whether they might have diabetes.
